# Lecture 1: Introduction

### Types of Machine Learning
#### Supervised
Collected samples are i.i.d. independent identity distributed.
For example in case of time series the samples are not i.i.d.

Examples of Supervised Learning

> spam detection, medical diagnosis, ad click prediction

#### Unsupervised
Goal is to learn about the distribution.

Examples of Unsupervised Learning

>Outlier detection, clustering, dimensionality reduction

#### Reinforcement
Learn to drive, play games.

# Lecture 2: Visualization and Matplotlib
